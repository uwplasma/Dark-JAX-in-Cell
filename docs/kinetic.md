# A mixed kinetic whisper

The full longitudinal benchmark starts a small, fixed physical $k$ density perturbation in a current-neutral Maxwellian electron population with a uniform fixed neutralizing background. It uses 150,000 quiet particles, 64 cells, 1,200 steps, $k\lambda_D=0.5$, $\mu/\omega_p=1$, and $\eta=0.3$. The coupling is deliberately large enough for numerical validation; it is not an observational dark-matter parameter. The deposited **mean current remains physical** rather than being removed each step.

For $\sigma=\sqrt{T/m}$, $\zeta=\omega/(\sqrt2 k\sigma)$, and the Landau-continued plasma dispersion function $Z$, the independent reference solves

$$
\chi_L=\frac{\omega_p^2}{k^2\sigma^2}[1+\zeta Z(\zeta)],\qquad
D_L=(s-\mu^2)(1+\chi_L)+\eta^2s\chi_L=0,\qquad s=\omega^2-c^2k^2.
$$

The reference root is $({{ kinetic_root_real }}{{ kinetic_root_imag }}i)\omega_p$; the PIC mode fit is $({{ kinetic_pic_real }}{{ kinetic_pic_imag }}i)\omega_p$. The real-frequency difference is **{{ kinetic_frequency_error }}%** and the damping-rate difference **{{ kinetic_damping_error }}%**. Five maxima between $\omega_pt=2.45$ and $11.225$ stand above the late mode floor; the fitted damping slope has a regression standard error of **{{ kinetic_damping_stderr }}** in $\omega_p$ units. The reference determinant residual and the exact window are stored in the [run record](_static/figures/mixed_kinetic/run.json).

The late floor contains a coherent dark branch as well as particle noise, so an unqualified single-mode fit to the entire record would be wrong. The quick preset is explicitly noise-limited and makes no fit. This is **one resolved mixed Landau case**, not a convergence study of all kinetic roots; two-stream and mixed Weibel branches are still pending. The full density/cell/time/seed refinements required for a kinetic convergence claim have not yet been completed.
